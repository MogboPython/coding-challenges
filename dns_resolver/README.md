# Simple DNS Resolver

This is a simple DNS resolver written in Go inspired by John Crickett's coding challenges. It sends DNS queries to a specified DNS server and parses the responses to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

## Usage

To run the DNS resolver, use the following command:

```sh
go run main.go <domain>
```

Replace <domain> with the domain name you want to resolve. For example:

```sh
go run main.go www.google.com

```
